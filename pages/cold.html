<p></p> 

<p style="font-family: lato;font-size: larger; margin-bottom:0px;"> The purpose of COLD Banking Suite is to create an in-house deFi money market for XFG deposit yield.</p>
<p style="font-family: lato;font-size: larger; margin-bottom:0px;">Allowing XFG to function as an interest-bearing asset, which will not only create additional network utility ( holders can earn tokens (currency, NFTs, etc) as interest on XFG deposit yield- exchangeable in a DeFi environment; without ever trading their XFG ) but more importantly, continues preserving the original hard supply and sound money principals of Fuego. </p>
<p style="font-family: lato;font-size: larger;">Details on all off-chain tokens to be offered thru COLD will be listed below.</p>

<p style="color:white;font-family: lato;font-size: large;font-weight: bold;">
Introductory inverse (to XFG)  asset of COLD Banking Suite and governance token for COLD Asset DAO.
</p>
<li style="font-family: lato;"><b>Ticker</b> : COLD</li>

<li style="font-family: lato;"><b>Decimals</b> : 12</li>

<li style="font-family: lato;"><b>Total Supply</b> : <b>80</b></li>

<li style="font-family: lato;"><b>Max Supply</b>:  Dynamic. After initial total of 80 is distributed, max supply will fluctuate (mint/burn based on market conditions) above/below 80, with the purpose of becoming an inverse asset of $XFG. ($COLD supply will be algorithmically managed to persuade pricing to function inversely to $XFG price)</li>

<li style="font-family: lato;"><b>Project governance</b> : Any amount</li>

<li style="font-family: lato;"><b>Monetary Policy</b> : 0.1 $COLD required (See goverance section)</li>

<li style="font-family: lato;"><b>Liquidity Interest Rate</b> : TBD - $COLD and Native Asset required (coming soon) </li>

<li style="font-family: lato;"><b>XFG Deposit Yield Rate</b> : 80%  (using a <b>supply</b> ratio of COLD to XFG of 1:100000 or 1 XFG = 0.00001 COLD) </li>

<p>
 example: For our initial onboarding wave, each time wXFG doubles or halves in price,
                   interest rates in Red Mercury (COLD) shall rise/fall by half.
                   
                   Such as:
                   
                   XFG at $0.0015 =  0.15% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $0.0033 =  0.33% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $0.0075 =  0.75% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $0.0125 =  1.25% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $0.0250 =  2.5% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $0.05   =  5% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $0.10   =  10% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $0.20   =  20% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $0.40   =  40% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $0.80   =  80% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $1.50   =  150% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $3.00   =  300% APR paid in COLD
                   XFG at $4.20   =  420% APR paid in COLD
                   and so on and so forth.
                                   
example yield @ 80% :
                800 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.0064 $COLD
              8,000 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.064 $COLD
             80,000 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.64 $COLD

             
       XFG price is the combined average of both wXFG & XFG markets.
       Transaction fees in COLD are burned at a rate dynamic to interest %
